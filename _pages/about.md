About Me
======
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in physics at [East China Normal University, ECNU](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/), and I will continue my studies at the same institution to pursue a master’s degree under the guidance of [Prof. Li](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s29/ll2/main.psp). My research focuses on integrated photonics and metasurfaces, and I am dedicated to exploring cutting-edge applications of photonic technologies.

Currently, my research centers on optical encryption, utilizing the multi-degree-of-freedom modulation properties of metasurfaces to enhance information security technologies. In the future, I plan to conduct in-depth research on the application of lithium niobate (LN) photonic chips in optical computing, contributing to the development of efficient computing technologies.

Additionally, I am studying optimization algorithms and aim to integrate fields such as algorithms, machine learning, and image recognition into the optimization and design of physics-related applications.
